# IPC-Project

This was my first take on a desktop app, and it consisted of an app to reserve tennis courts. It was created using Netbeans and Scenebuilder. It was coded by a group of 3 studends during our second year of our computer engineering degree in the UPV. Lastly, this project is not a proper example on how to build an app, we were still very new to the tools and language, aswell as the methodology.
